#1. Store 22/7 in a variable called pi and check its type
pi = 22 / 7
print("Value of pi:", pi)
print("Data type of pi:", type(pi))


#2. Create a variable called for and assign it a value 4.

for = 4
print(for)

Output- It is a syntax error
Reason- 'for' is a reserved keyword in Python. You cannot use it as a variable name.


#3. Calculate Simple Interest
principal = 5000    
rate = 5          
time = 3           

simple_interest = (principal * rate * time) / 100
print(f"simple_interest =",simple_interest)
